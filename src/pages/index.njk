					<p>Hi! My name is Tanya and Iâ€™m a frontend developer.</p>
					<p>I'm fond of the web. I like to learn and explore something new about development and gain useful developer skills. My main professional goal is helping to create accessible, adaptive, and user-friendly interfaces which people like.</p>
					<p>I write and translate articles about accessibility, write posts about it in <a href="https://tatiana-fokina-blog.ru">my blog</a>, and sometimes I have talks. Also, I'm a co-organizer of the first Russian language meetup about accessibility pitera11y_meetup.</p>

			<h3>Articles and Translations</h3>
			<p>I like to share my knowledge with other people and learn something new by myself. Therefore I write and translate texts about accessibility when I don't write a code.</p>
			<p>Here are a few of my articles.</p>
			<ul class="writes">

			<h3>Pitera11y_meetup</h3>
			<div class="two-column-section">
				<div>
					<p>This is the first Russian language meetup about accessibility. The audience is various. The meetup is for developers, designers, QA engineers, technical writers, and everybody else who is a part of creating something on the Internet.</p>
					<p>I like other organizers who find speakers, help to make talks, arrange with owners of platforms and places, write announcements and create graphics. The most interesting part of it add manual Russian captions for the meetup video. There is
						<a href="{{ links.public.pitera11yPlaylist }}">a list of every talks on YouTube</a>.
